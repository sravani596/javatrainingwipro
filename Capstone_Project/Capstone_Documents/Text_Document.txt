4. **As a developer**, I want to provide detailed documentation, so future developers can understand the system.

### **Project Flow**
1. **Backend Setup (Spring Boot)**:
   - Set up Spring Boot for various services like farming partners, customers, products, orders, and payments.
   - RESTful APIs will expose CRUD operations to manage product catalogs, customer profiles, orders, and more.
   - Use JWT for security, ensuring different user roles (farmers, customers, admins) are managed properly.
   - Integrate payment gateway APIs to handle transactions.

2. **Frontend Development (Angular)**:
   - Develop user-friendly Angular components to allow customers to browse products, place orders, manage subscriptions, and more.
   - Angular services will consume the Spring Boot RESTful APIs to fetch or update data dynamically.

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add real-time product availability features, customer reviews and ratings, and a dashboard to manage orders.
   - Enhance the frontend with CSS3 transitions and animations for a smooth user experience.
   - Implement data validation during user registration and sign-in for better security.

4. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Decompose the platform into multiple microservices (as outlined above), ensuring scalability, modularity, and easier management.
   - Use Eureka for service discovery and an API Gateway to handle inter-service communication.
   - Containerize services using Docker and ensure smooth communication with APIs.

5. **Testing, Deployment, and Monitoring**:
   - Write unit and integration tests using testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, and Jest.
   - Deploy the system on Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and high availability in the cloud.
   - Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) and logging (e.g., ELK stack) for tracking the health and performance of your microservices.
